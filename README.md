## Summary
Avatar Enhancement is a project that harnesses the capabilities of Netcode, an advanced networking technology in Unity, to provide a secure and offline networking solution. Unlike other libraries like Photon and Fish, which may lack robust security measures or require constant online connectivity, Netcode offers a reliable and safe alternative that can be used offline.

The project includes essential features such as user movement controls, camera rotation, and an intuitive UI for hosting and connecting clients.Moreover, it operates offline, making it well-suited for LAN parties, local tournaments, and scenarios where an internet connection is not available or desired.

Avatar Enhancement is an evolving project, continuously introducing new features to enhance gameplay possibilities. The latest additions include a drone camera for capturing unique perspectives and waypoint placing for AI-controlled cars, unlocking exciting opportunities for your projects.
